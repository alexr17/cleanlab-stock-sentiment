"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had a big reason to celebrate this past weekend.

On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable public company, thanks to its position in riding the AI software wave.

The company is now valued at $2.89T, surpassing Apple which is currently valued at $2.87T.

Apple has struggled in recently, experiencing four consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines across its product offerings.

To make matters worse, Chinese government and state firms have been increasingly banning foreign devices like iPhones.

This presents a major challenge for the company as China represents 19% of Apple‚Äôs revenue.

"I can comment on this one actually. I know semiconductors and the industry better than most but I‚Äôm no expert so YMMV etc. disclaimers. 

Intel is a very long way from using their ASML Deep EUV machine. Yes they got the first one. But now they have to develop the technology to use it. It‚Äôs new territory with all these new lithography machines. They don‚Äôt come ready to use out of the box. They are probably 2-5 years from having a process ready that uses it. 

Further- you can‚Äôt just take your design and stick it in a new process node. You actually have to design the chip specifically for that node. Especially when you move manufacturers. The silicon made by intel and TSMC is actually quite different. So when they moved their manufacturing to TSMC they didn‚Äôt just take their design and hand it over. No, it was a massive investment to redesign the chips for the TSMC process. Things stay generally in the same place and the same superficial arrangement is there but at the gate level things look different. 

Intel has really faltered on execution lately. With their 10 nm process they really fell apart. In some ways they bit off more than they can chew. They tried to add 3 new really advanced techniques into the process that would have rocketed them ahead of TSMC had they worked. But they couldn‚Äôt get them to work for a few years. TSMC is much better at executing and delivering new processes. They go for small incremental improvements each year. 

Intel isn‚Äôt even manufacturing their newest generation themselves. That‚Äôs critical here. Most the semiconductor companies you talk about are either design houses or foundries or equipment makers. Intel did all three for years. So buying intel you are buying into all three industries. They fell apart on equipment and are buying outside equipment with ASMLs new machine. And they fell down on manufacturing with TSMC actually manufacturing the processor tiles for their new SKUs. 

AMD is a much smaller company and much more efficient. They design one chip well and then reuse it in all their parts with different packaging processes and their ‚Äúchiplet‚Äù designs. Intel makes dozens of different masks. And each one takes engineering time. 
Also, AMD spun off their in house foundry as Global Foundries about 10 years ago. So they don‚Äôt have to worry about that. They design their silicon for TSMC‚Äôs process and rely on them to innovate and deliver. 

All that said, I do think Intel is oversold. They still have massive market share in the consumer and server markets. They‚Äôre losing market share but we‚Äôre talking from 95% to 85%. They are pulling much lower margins though because the ferocious competition from AMD forces them to lower their prices. And honestly AMD has the better server and consumer CPU parts IMHO. Intel has much stronger relationships with the system integrators from years and years of partnership and shady business practices so that companies like Dell and Lenovo and server manufacturers like Super Micro all tend to use Intel processors. AMD has struggled in this regard. 

The bigger story though is that AMD has a ton of room to grow by stealing market share. And Intel has little place to go but hold the line or lose more share. Those relationships are really strong though and it‚Äôs worth looking into the arrangements they have with the integrators. 

Intel has new management with a technical background instead of a sales background and that might help get the company back into the lead technologically but like getting a new head coach on a football team, it takes years to rebuild your bench and get the ball rolling on new research. Also the gains are getting harder and harder. The gates are only a few dozen atoms now. They aren‚Äôt really at this point getting smaller - they‚Äôre getting more dense which creates an ‚Äúequivalent shrinkage‚Äù. So 5 nm wasn‚Äôt 5nm feature size anymore it was a density as if the feature size was 5nm. So the power requirements aren‚Äôt going down like they should. But with the density increasing and the number of gates increasing and the amount of leakage in tiny gates means that power consumption and heat production are limiting factors. AMDs new cores are actually the same core. The efficiency cores are just smaller than the power cores. So the ‚Äúefficiency cores‚Äù just have to run slower because they are so dense and the heat gets built up. 

There‚Äôs a lot to like with Intel but there are also very significant hurdles and many years of hard work to demonstrate that they can deliver - especially when it‚Äôs increasingly hard to make process node advancements. Exponential even.  If they deliver on backside power delivery first they might have a chance. Opening up the foundry might help. Especially with the US govt throwing money around for domestic production. But they won‚Äôt be making bleeding edge chips. They‚Äôll be making lower margin more mundane chips with their (relatively) less advanced lithography. Though 14nm and 10 and 7 are pretty solid nodes.",0.9978,1008,0,4124,0,2024-06-26 16:06:07,450.95001220703125

"To translate the concept in the image to basketball terms, consider the following analogy:

- **The Middle East (Silicon Valley in the image)**: This would be akin to the hotbeds of basketball talent, such as regions or cities known for producing top players, like New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles.
  
- **The Majors (Meta, Apple, etc.)**: These are the powerhouse basketball teams, like the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, Golden State Warriors, and Miami Heat, that have the most influence and resources.

- **Oil Fields (Data Centers)**: These represent the basketball courts and training facilities where the game is played and players are developed. Just like data is stored in data centers, basketball skills are honed on the courts.

- **OPEC (NVIDIA)**: This would be the governing bodies of basketball, such as the NBA or FIBA, which control the rules and distribution of the sport's resources and influence.

- **The Saudi Crown Prince (NVIDIA's CEO)**: This is akin to influential figures in basketball, such as the NBA Commissioner or team owners who have significant control over the league's operations.

- **The Embargo (Biden)**: This represents league sanctions or rules that can restrict player movements or team actions, like salary caps, trade restrictions, or suspensions.

- **Smugglers (Data Pirates)**: These are like agents or individuals who try to bend the rules, sometimes unethically, to get the best deals or recruit players.

- **Light, Sweet Crude (High-quality data)**: In basketball, this would be the top-tier talent‚Äîelite players who are highly sought after.

- **The Kuwaiti Oilfields (High-value data sources)**: These are the major basketball tournaments and leagues that are highly competitive and valuable, such as the NBA Finals or the NCAA Tournament.

- **Saddam Hussein (Geopolitical figure)**: This would be a controversial figure in basketball, perhaps a player or owner known for being divisive or causing significant disruption.

- **TSMC (TSMC in the image)**: Equivalent to critical elements in basketball like shoe brands (Nike, Adidas), which are essential for the sport but operate in the background.

In summary, the image depicts the tech world and data using the oil industry as an analogy, while the basketball version of this analogy uses teams, players, and governing bodies to represent the same concepts.

"Regression to the mean. It‚Äôs very rare for anyone to keep making top hits, let alone a successor.

A lot of companies are desperate to be able to get rid of in-house servers and their in house IT employees and are willing to pay a premium to do it

And well just on the surface level if I was given a choice between trusting Microsoft or Amazon with sensitive data my gut tells me go with Microsoft",0.3682,55,0,2356,0,2024-01-11 22:49:03,382.7699890136719
